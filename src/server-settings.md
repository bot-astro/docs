Astro has very few server settings, all available under [!badge /settings].  
You can get a list of those commands with [!badge /commands category:Server settings].

### Viewing your settings
You can view all your server settings at any time with [!badge /settings info].

### Get notified about issues and errors
You can set an error-logs channel with [!badge /settings error-logs].  
Astro will report all the issues and errors that it encounters in that channel.
!!!warning
It is recommended to set an error-logs channel!

### Ban specific commands
Astro commands can be managed directly via *Server settings :icon-arrow-right: Integrations :icon-arrow-right: Astro*.  
If you wanna ban specific [!badge /vc] commands and not the whole group, you can use [!badge /settings banned-commands].  
[!ref Manage commands](temporary-voice-channels/user-commands.md)

### Fixing wrong settings
Astro can fix any wrong setting automatically with [!badge /settings fix].
