# Temporary voice channels
This is the main feature of Astro.  
It allows users to **create their own voice channel** that **they can manage** and then **delete it when it gets empty**.  

Some important things to notice:
- Each temporary voice channel has an **owner**.  
  An owner can manage its channel, for example change the name, the user limit, etc...
- When the owner leaves the channel, the **ownership** gets transferred to another non-bot user in the channel.

[!ref Check out some examples](/examples)  

**âœ¨ To set up temporary voice channels in your server keep on reading this guide!**
