Variables can be used to customize channel names and messages from Astro.  
You can get a list of variables with [!badge /info variables].  

As an example, if you set the temporary voice channel names to `Channel of {nickname}`, `{nickname}` will be replaced with the nickname of the user that creates the temporary voice channel.  

### Incremental numbers
You can get channels ordered and numbered by using incremental variables.  
As an example, if you wanna have a system that looks like this:
- #1 Giuliopime's voice channel
- #2 Daluxea's voice channel
- #3 Xavin's voice channel
- #4 Rxsto's voice channel  

You should set the temporary voice channel names to `#{n} {nickname}'s voice channel` with [!badge /generator vc name].  
Incremental values can also be roman numbers, nato numbers and more, to check them all see [!badge /info variables].  

##### How Astro will handle positioning and ordering
Considering the new Discord Limitation which permits to change a channel name only 2 times per every 10 minutes, here is how Astro handles this feature:  
> The voice channels will be generated incrementally, the bot will find the first missing voice channel and put the new voice channel in its place.
> 
> **Example**  
> We have 5 voice channels generated by Astro incrementally [`VC #1`, `VC#2`, `VC #3`, `VC #4` and `VC#5`], now let's say `VC #3` gets deleted, what Astro will **not** do is rename every single VC to the proper name, so `VC#4` to `VC #3` and so on, instead, the next time a VC will be created it will not be `VC #6` but `VC #3` so that the gap gets filled.
> 
> This allows Astro not to break because of the new Discord Limitation.
