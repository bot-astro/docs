## What can Astro do?
Astro focuses on just voice channels at the moment.  
Its two main features are:
- [!badge variant="info" text="Temporary voice channels"](temporary-voice-channels/index.md)
- [!badge variant="info" text="Voice roles"](voice-roles.md)

!!!info
There are some more cool features planned, and a dashboard is in the works too ^^
!!!
## Requirements
- [x] Astro needs [!badge variant="success" text="Administrator"] permissions in your server  
- [x] Your server must not have more than 50 bots, that is a limit set by Discord itself
- [x] You need [!badge variant="success" text="Manage channels"] permission in the server in order to configure Astro

!!!primary Professional servers notice
If you own a professional server and cannot assign Administrator permission to Astro for security reasons, please contact the developers via the [!badge variant="info" text="Support Server"](https://astro-bot.space/support).  
!!!

## Setup
You can setup Astro in one simple command with the [!badge /setup] slash command.  
This command will create a basic setup for your server that you will be able to edit and customize to your likings.  

You can also start from scratch by following the next sections of this documentation.
