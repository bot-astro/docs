# Old premium members
Getting premium on the Astro website is now not supported anymore, you can only get premium in the App Directory.  
Some features are missing, like discounts, user premium and some other things, but they are likely coming in the future.  

### Manage or cancel your old subscription
To manage the subscription you got on the website head over to [the premium page](https://astro-bot.space/premium), then login with your Discord account on the top right.  
After that, click on your profile and then hit `Billing`.  
You will be brought to a page that lets you edit your payment methods or cancel your subscriptions.
